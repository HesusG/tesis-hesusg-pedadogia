On the one hand, it is hard to argue that Japan possesses adequate competitiveness with regard to AI technology. On the other hand, Japan, along with pursuing Society 5.01 and contributing to the solution of global issues (SDGs 2 ), aims to create a "Circulating and Ecological Economy 3 ," as a model for practical implementation in the field of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) . And Japan must take action in advance of other countries to resolve many social issues faced by a mature society such as an aging population, shrinking population and deterioration of infrastructure. These issues are not problems that can be solved with technologies such as AI, but it is necessary to coordinate technology and social mechanisms in a transformational way in order to realize a "sustainable society that incorporates diversity". At the March 2017 Artificial Intelligence Technology Strategy Council meeting, Japan ese government drew up the Artificial Intelligence Technology Strategy and its Industrialization Roadmap, which designates " productivity," "health, medical care, and long -term care," "mobility," and "information security" as core areas of focus, where the public and private sectors will collaborate on 1 The 5th Science and Technology Basic Plan states "We will provide the necessary things and services to people who need them, and when necessary, respond precisely to the various needs of society, providing high quality services for all people, creating a society where all people can receive high-quality services and can live actively and comfortably, overcoming various differences in age, gender, region, and language." The Comprehensive Strategy on Science, Technology and Innovation 2017 states "Cyber and Physical Spaces should be highly integrated to provide products and services that meet the diverse needs and potential needs without disparities due to things such as region, age, gender, or language. This is a human- centric society that can balance economic development and social issues, and allow people to live comfortable, vibrant, high-quality lives." 2 Sustainable Development Goals: The international goals from 2016 to 2030 described in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted at the UN Summit in September of 2015, consisting of 17 goals and 169 targets to realize a sustainable world, and pledge to leave no one on earth behind. 3 In the 5th Basic Environment Plan (April 17, 2018 Cabinet Decision) "This Plan aims to create a "Circulating and Ecological Economy” that produces new value chains, complements and supports regional resources by building broader networks, which is composed of natural connections (connections among forests, the countryside, rivers and the sea) and, economic connections (composed of human resources, funds, and others), while making full use of mountainous, agricultural and fishing villages, and cities. Each region will demonstrate its strengths by utilizing its unique characteristics, thereby building a self-reliant and decentralized society where different resources are circulated within each region, and symbiosis and exchange with neighboring regions according to unique characteristics of each region." 2 AI technology spanning the full pipeline from R&D to social implementation. In August of 2018, an action plan oriented towards further embodying and strengthening the government's efforts based on this Strategy was put together; the action plan specifies the objectives and timetable for accomplishment for each initiative. However, w ith regard to the deployment of AI technology in domains such as big data, there has been an increasingly fierce battle for supremacy over the last few years among companies based in certain countries, notably the US and China, along with various disruptive innovations in various fields that defy conventional projections of advances, all of which has left Japan in a position of having falling behind. Conversely, some hold the view that because the extent of potential fields for introducing AI technology is so wide, competition in areas such as data collection and utilization in the field has just begun, and the decisive contest is yet to come. Given this, in order to take the next step forward in overcoming issues facing Japan, making use of Japan’s strengths to open up opportunities for the future, we will focus on measures that Japan ese government should immediately take concerted action on, which are summarized in this Strategy. I. Basic Concept (A) Scope of the Strategy The term "Artificial Intelligence (hereinafter AI)" in this S trategy presumes a system that realizes an intelligent function4. 4 AI (artificial intelligence), for example, in the EC High-Level Expert Group report, it is considered as "a system that performs intelligent operations (sometimes with certain autonomy) in response to environment and input", however, the substance of "intelligent action" also has an aspect that depends on interpretation. Also, the AI-100 report published in the US in 2016, cites the definition of Nils J. Nilsson that AI as a field of study is "research that makes intelligent machines, and intelligence works properly with some kind of insight in the environment where it is placed", but this definition has great ambiguity. In fact, in the same report, the vague definition of AI itself has a positive aspect that is accelerating AI research. In light of these circumstances, although there is a certain consensus regarding whether to judge something as "AI" or "AI technology", it is not meaningful to define it more strictly on the basis of the technology, etc. used there. At the same time, it should be noted that such a system is incorporated into a highly complex system. Furthermore, implementation of the AI system cannot be realized without the necessary infrastructure for large-scale data collection and storage, infrastructure access, ultra-high-speed communication networks, sensors, robots, and the like. Without the development and implementation of technology that ensures the safety and soundness of such systems, such as cyber security and AI ethics, it will be difficult for AI to be widely accepted. AI encompasses a wide range of systems that realize functions considered to be intelligent and is expected to extend into all domains, ranging from the society and industry of the future to daily life, scientific research and technology development. Accordingly, this strategy must address planning for all these domains in an integrated manner. 3 Although AI in recent years is mainly based on machine learning, especially deep learning, AI related technology is rapidly developing, and the definition of AI is not limited solely to technology used for AI. (B) Purpose of the Strategy The purpose of this Strategy is to specify the environment and measures conducive to effective future utilization of AI for the purposes of contributing to the solution of global issues through realization of Society 5.0 and overcoming the issues facing Japanese society. This Strategy establishes an integrated policy package for AI that encompasses educational reform, research and development (R&D) and social implementation in order to contribute to the world, overcome challenges, and ultimately improve Japan's industrial competitiveness. (C) Principles behind the Strategy In March of 2019, the government compiled the "Social Principles of Human-Centric AI." This document specifies the form of society that Japan should aim for, a multilateral framework, and a policy direction that the national and local governments should aim for as AI develops. It defines three points as its basic principles: (i) Dignity - A society in which human dignity is respected (ii) Diversity and Inclusion - A society in which people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their own well-being. (iii) Sustainability - A sustainable society. This Strategy respects these basic principles. (D) Basic Concept for Strategy Promotion In order to realize the basic principles of section (C) above, that is, to have a "sustainable society that incorporates diversity", it is important to introduce new technologies including AI in parallel with reforming social systems. Furthermore, it is essential that the introduction of AI yield benefits that are tangible to individual citizens and that new technologies and social systems are widely accepted. In addition, while moving forward with the implementation of Society 5.0, Japan m ust improve its international presence and radically strengthen its industrial competitiveness. In doing so, as laid out in the "Social Principles of Human-Centric AI," it is important for diverse human resources, regardless 4 of their diverse backgrounds in terms of gender, age, political beliefs, and religion to be able to contribute based on a wide range of knowledge, perspectives, ideas, and so on. The government, as the overall coordinator , bearing in mind the above -mentioned points, needs to steadily promote the various measures described in this Strategy while maintaining full awareness of the following points. (i) The main players in industry are private sector companies, and for these companies to exercise their full capabilities, factors such as provision of foundations (training and recruiting of human resources, promotion of R&D, maintenance of the industrial base and support for commercialization), the establish ment of a system to accelerate the introduction of new technologies and removal of impeding factors , and the establishment of a multinational framework are essential. (ii) Implementation of the AI system requires, for example, large-scale data collection and storage, infrastructure for access, ultra-high-speed communication networks, sensor clusters, and robots. (iii) In order to achieve the social acceptance of AI, it is important to develop and implement technology, including cyber security and AI ethics, that ensures system safety and integrity; to improve literacy related to AI; to have appropriate communication between developers/operators and users; and to foster recognition of the tangible benefits of AI. (E) Strategic Objectives The following strategic objectives are set for this Strategy. Strategic Objective 1 For Japan to develop a base of human resources which, in proportion to population, leads the world in being aligned with the needs of the AI era, and to become a country that attracts human resources from around the world. In addition, to build a mechanism to achieve this objective on a sustainable basis. "Human resources aligned with the needs of the AI era" are not a uniform type of person. T hey may be divided into various categories, such as ・People who carry out advanced AI research; ・People who apply AI to industry; 5 ・People who realize application in small and medium-sized businesses; ・People engaged in new business creation using AI; However categorized, each category needs to have a deep talent pool. In order to deepen the talent pool , it is important to have strategies to develop and attract people according to their needs, including diverse human resources including women and people from overseas who aspire to work in Japan. Therefore, in the future, it will be important to establish a leading-edge education programs, and further, it will be necessary to enhance it to a level that can be offered overseas as well. In daily life, more effective use of AI improves the convenience of life and enables people to do things that could not have been done without AI. However, in order to do so, it is necessary to raise people's literacy of AI and make it possible for each individual to appreciate and utilize the benefits of AI willingly and without anxiety. Strategic Objective 2 For Japan to become a frontrunner in the application of AI to real-world industry and to achieve strengthened industrial competitiveness. The "real world industry" 5 domain encompasses value-generating activities which cannot be fully executed within cyberspace, but only by interactions among people, nature, hardware, etc. This domain contains a vast amount of information that has not yet been systematically acquired. In this domain, because in many cases it is extremely important to promote the transition to high value- added industries centered on service platforms, we aim to improve Japan's industrial competitiveness and secure and maintain a position as a frontrunner in the world by promoting AI related development support, system design, and laying of foundations for social implementation that contribute s to this transition. This is an objective to be realized in conjuncti on with policies other than AI s trategy, but there AI strategy unquestionably plays an important part. Labor productivity can be considered as a 5 A generic term for industries that provide some value in the physical real world, such as medicine, agriculture, materials, logistics, and manufacturing equipment. In contrast to SNS and search services, it is characterized as not being completed within cyberspace, but creates value for the first time through interaction with people, nature, hardware, etc. 6 measure of industrial competitiveness. As a reference, in order to reach labor productivity levels 6 equivalent to those of other countries such as the US, Germany and France with in the next 10 years or so, Japan must maintain a nominal labor productivity growth rate of over 6% for 10 years, making it clear that a very bold change in industrial structure is necessary. And concurrently, through this domain Japan can contribute to the achievement of SDGs on a global scale. In addition, it is also important to aim at further improvement of service quality, improvement of the working environment, and ultimately the reduction of fiscal burdens by applying AI in the public service sector. Note that the type of service industries that are almost completely in cyberspace, such as e -commerce and SNS, are a subject for future study. Strategic Objective 3 For a series of technology systems to be established in Japan that will realize a " sustainable society that incorporates diversity", and to implement a mechanism to operate them. It is extremely important for women, foreigners, elderly people and other diverse people with diverse backgrounds to be able to fully participate in society while enjoying diverse lifestyles. We will promote the establishment of AI-related diverse technology systems along with the creation of social systems and mechanisms to use them with the aim of individual citizen being able to enjoy tangible benefits. In addition, this strategic objective is not intended to be limited in scope by Japan's borders; it is important to formulate a plan for implementation on the premise that promoting this objective on a global scale can significantly contribute to the achievement of SDGs. Strategic Objective 4 For Japan to take a leadership role in building international research, education, and social infrastructure networks in the AI field, and to accelerate AI-related R&D, human resource development, achievement of SDGs, etc. 6 Nominal labor productivity (per hour) of major countries in 2017: US $72.0 USD, Germany $69.8, France $67.8, Japan $47.5 (all converted to purchasing power parity) (Source: Japan Productivity Foundation Headquarters "International Comparison of Labor Productivity in 2018"). 7 With economic and social globalization rapidly advancing , objectives such as AI related human resource development/provision and industrial development cannot be fully accomplished solely within Japan, so we must always maintain an international perspective. For example , in human resource development and provision, it is necessary to provide many venues for overseas researches and engineers to be active in Japan, and to increase joint R&D and joint projects between Japan and foreign countries. For this reason, in addition to strengthening collaboration with research and education institutions and companies in North America and Europe, we will fully engage in collaborations with regions having future growth prospects such as ASEAN, India, the Middle East, and Africa. We will provide AI related education programs to these areas, and take the opportunity of TICAD7 (Yokohama) to contribute to the promotion of AI research and commercialization in those areas. To achieve this, the core centers of the AI Research and Development Network, etc., in each priority area will need to clarify plans for which areas in which to conduct world- leading research and, with respect to emergent research, how to draw on an international talent pool in order to maintain the diversity of human resources and themes. Additionally, in fields such as health, medical care, and long-term care, agriculture, and smart cities, we aim for international collaboration and cooperation at a scale that offers mutual advantages in terms of human resources, data and markets. (F) Role Sharing Between Public and Private Sectors A unified effort between the public and private sectors is essential to realize this Strategy. Among these, by carrying out the following activities, the government 1will maintain an environment for the creation of a new society for the future (Society 5.0) and assiduously support private sector efforts towards the renovation of Japan's industrial structure through activities such as improving productivity, creating diverse value, and launching clusters of start-up companies.  Development of strategy and formulation of a roadmap to realize it  Immediate removal of institutional and policy obstacles  Establishing networks for problem solving among multiple stakeholders  Development of human resources including domestic and foreign workers  Social implementation of s ocial structure transformation and measures for the survival of the nation  Fundamental R&D, next generation basic research  Provision of a common environment for acceleration of AI utilization  Ethics, formation of national and international governance systems  Creation of a "global network" hub 8 It is necessary for t he private sector, on the other hand, with full understanding of the purpose of this Strategy, to comply with the Social Principles of AI and to pursue international collaboration with other countries/regions and cooperation with diverse stakeholders while introducing an internationally competitive compensation system for talented human resources . Furthermore, for the sake of jointly creating the future, the private sector must actively contribute to future economic and social development with the awareness of their core role in undertaking a major challenge. 9 II. Building a Foundation for the Future: Education Reform and Reconstruction of the Research and Development System II-1 Education Reform Currently, our society is undergoing a major transition through digital transformation. One of the major driving forces of this change is AI, and there is the increasing demand for human resources capable of creating and using AI, designing new ways of society (a "sustainable society that incorporates diversity"), designing products and services suitable for the new society and creating new value. It is no exaggeration to say that this, coupled with the ability to collect, store and analyze big data, is one of the biggest factors determining the vitality of society and industry in the future. For this reason, the training and securing of related human resources is an urgent and a long-term issues including primary and secondary, higher, recurrent7 and lifelong education. Above all, it is important to have the ability to design new ways of society, products and services, based on the knowledge and skills related to "mathematics, data science and AI" and on humanities, social sciences and arts education. It will be essential to have radical improvement of traditional methods of education, introduce and strengthen new methods such as STEAM education8, and perform cross- disciplinary learning for problem solving in the world. Additionally, it is essential to have a strong understanding of the relationship between various social issues and science and mathematics from an early stage, and the experience of thinking to solve them with science and mathematics. In order to achieve this, it is also necessary to rapidly develop ICT infrastructure in schools, including an information education environment for each child student, and a school affairs support system for education. Furthermore, if Japan can build new education model for mathematics, data science, and AI in the age of Society 5.0 in advance of other countries, it will be possible to strongly disseminate it to the world, especially to the Asian region. 7 This is education for working members of society, especially professionals, after completion of their regular schooling, and includes not only full-time re-education, but also includes part-time education while working. 8 Cross-disciplinary education used to apply learning in individual disciplines including Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics to problem solving in the real world. 10 ＜Main Objectives＞ The following goals for future education are set keeping in mind their realization by 2025, with the aim for human resources to be active in all fields of society and for all citizens to be cultivated the capability to participate in creating a sustainable society, the power w hich includes the knowledge and skills related to "Mathematics, Data Science, and AI", as the basic knowledge of the digital society (like the so -called "Reading, Writing, Abacus" basics), and the basic skills necessary to design new ways of society, products and services.:  For all senior high school graduates to acquire basic literacy in "Science and M athematics, Data Science, and AI".

Japan’s AI research has begun to lag noticeably in fundamental areas, exemplified by slowness to effectively utilize big data, knowledge, and computing resources, and inadequacy of application s contributing to social implementation. Combined with the relative decline of the Japanese economy in the global economy, it has now become difficult for Japan to conduct a domestic-only agenda for various AI related technology R&D. Moreover, this is also contributing to a dela y in deployment of AI in complex sectors such as manufacturing, medical practice and mobility. In Japan, there is a history of basic research, general-purpose research, and applied research in each sector developing independently in a decentralized fashion . While they have formed a group of AI - related core centers20 with excellent capabilities in certain basic research, and public research institutes that have an excellent track record of applied research in specific fields, it is undeniable that there have been few crossover activities between them. From now on, in order to further improve Japa n’s AI related research capabilities and push forward with social implementation of research results, it is important for all the research institutes to cooperate and complement each other while demonstrating their own strengths, making it necessary to establish a R&D network centered on AI related core centers. Among these, each AI -related core center is expected to continue to produce world -class results in each priority area and to become an international hub. So far, the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) has been researching and developing innovative fundamental technologies centering on theoretical research and integrally advancing them to the social implementation stage; the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) is engaged in R&D focusing on natural language processin g, multilingual translation, 20 Includes the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology AI Research Center (AIST AIRC), National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Universal Communication Research Institute (UCRI), and the Center for Information and Neural Networks (CiNet) 25 multilingual speech processing, cognitive model building of the brain, and provision and social implementation of a usage environment including stored data ; and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technolo gy ( AIST) AI Research Center (AIRC) has mainly pursued social implementation centered on bridging (the practical application side) to companies with superior AI technology. Moving forward, RIKEN AIP aims to be the world leader in R&D of innovative fundamental technologies cent ering on AI theoretical research , NICT aims for the realizatio n of interactive technology through innovative natural language processing using large -scale data, developing multilingual translation and speech processing tec hnology including handling of foreign visitors from Asia and foreigners residing in Japan, and being the world's top leader in construction and application of a cognitive model of the brain aiming at the realization of heart-to-heart communication, and AIST AIRC aims to lead the world as the core research organization bridging AI based technology and society to real-world applications of AI. Additionally, each AI-related core center aims to rapidly transfer research results to find uses in society. On the other hand, on the front lines of R&D, there is an urgency to deal with new issues such as ensuring the quality of AI, securing the reliability of the entire network, and responding to cyber-attacks. In order to respond to these issues, not only the linear extension of R&D conducted up until now, but also new engineering approaches and cross -disciplinary approaches are indispensable, as is quickly pivoting away from follow-up research that loses sight of Japan's strengths. First of all, in order to make use of Japan's strengths and to revitalize Japan's future, (i) development of AI for the real-world domain and (ii) AI designed for inclusion will be the two major pillars of R&D. It is essential to construct a technological system aligned with these pillars, to push forward with basic research, and then advance to application and implementation . Additionally, as a premise of these pillars, it is important for Japan to establish a stack of technologies and operational know-how to develop AI with a high and reliable level of quality (Trusted Quality AI). This is important both in t erms of reflecting the principles in the " Social Principles of Human -Centric AI" and in terms of establishing a competitive advantage. In the application of AI to the real world domain, it is important to establish the theory, technology base, and development and operation process that will make the development of an effective AI system possible under the constraints of data of very high dimensionality with inaccuracy and incompleteness, 26 and in many cases, where a sufficient amount of data cannot be obtained . In addition, since the AI system is a system integrated with sensors, IoT, robots, infrastructure, etc., it is important to have a technology base on which these systems can easily be built. It is necessary to establish a R&D system that views the process in terms of the full pipeline from research results to social implementation. Additionally, the cluster of technologies that support the realization of diversity and social inclusion , called "inclusion technology", has among its aims to realize the principles of universal design within a large framework linked to the pursuit of R&D oriented towards the development and implementation of inclusion technology and the realization of institutional reforms and digital government. At the present time, inclusion technology is not a well- established concept, and due to the nature of meeting diverse needs of diverse people, is not a single technology but rather a collection of diverse technologies. For this reason, it is necessary to identify technology, operation and organizational universality and to establish a new technology system . As an emergent research field, inclusion technology, while focusing on a number of themes with obvious applications, must at the same time progress towards creating diverse solutions for diverse needs. Furthermore, when viewed from the perspective of medium and long-term innovation, it is critical to have emerging research oriented toward creating new value that cannot be predicted at the present stage, generating diverse seeds, and spurring cross-disciplinary integration at the basic research stage. Consequently, we emphasize the diversity of R&D and set up the following four R&D approaches (programs): (i) Basic research on AI and development of foundational technologies (AI Core) (ii) R&D on applying AI to real-world industries (iii) R&D on achieving inclusion through AI (iv) Emerging research to pioneer blue-sky fields and technologies arising from a diversity of ideas Among these, approaches (i) to (iii) are strategic programs, that is, programs based on recognition and prediction of technolo gy trends, issues in Japan, and future directions, and are premised o n a certain course of action and scenarios. In addition, (ii) and (iii) have aspects that r equire research based on diversity in problem identification and ideas, and a certain percentage will be implemented as a theme- oriented emergent research program. 27 The emergent research in approach (iv) should be a program that imposes no constraints on research content, based on the fact that research that leads to many disruptive innovations is actually being generated from non -focused areas. At the same time, it is necessary to design programs with an emphasis on diversity, under the hypothesis that emergent research is created from the integration of diverse human resources and disciplines . Also, in this context, it is necessary to establish a globally attractive system design and operation system. In view of the difficulty of Japan going it alone in conducting various AI related technology R&D, we will make up for the shortage of domestic human resources in the future by attracting and exchanging international human resources, therefore recruitment and management of programs must be conducted in English. ＜Main Objectives＞  Building of a comprehensive R&D cycle spanning basic

in the following four areas, and strategically promote their R&D 1. Basic Theories and Technologies of AI 2. Device and Architecture for AI 3. Trusted Quality AI 4. System Components of AI (Initiatives)  Based on the overall structure of AI R &D below, referring to (Appended Table 1), creating a development pipeline chart in the field of AI related R&D (FY 2019) and reviewing it annually [MIC, MEXT, METI] Figure: Overall Structure of AI R&D 4. AI Core - System Components of AI Other Creative Discovery Type AI Real World Application AI Human Symbiosis Type AI Real-World Domain Basic Research 33 III. Establishing a Foundation for Industry and Society III - 1 Social Implementation As already emphasized, by combining Japan’s technology strengths with AI technology, we must aim to realize a "sustainable society that incorporates diversity" while contributing to the solution of global issues, creating substantial added value, improving productivity, and further strengthening industrial competitiveness. In particular, the real -world industry domain is an area where Japanese companies have a large presence in the world at present . Consequently , Japan should be able to demonstrate superior ity and take leadership in the realization of application of AI technology to the real-world industry domain (AI for Real World) and inclusion (AI for Inclusion). However, in developing and deploying AI systems for the real-world industry domain, it is essential to provide domain -specific expertise and know -how, as well as deal with case- by-case factors, including operation. For this reason, in the current situation where the source of value has shifted to the service platform, settling for business models that are simply an extension of linear trends up to the present could result in Japanese industry losing preeminence, as hardware and other devices become terminals of service platforms, At this point, first of all, as a sector-wide effort, in order to promote structural transformation to high value-added service industries (as measured by GDP per Capita, etc.) centered on AI-driven services and to dramatically improve productivity, it is necessary to develop architecture-based technology and form social implementation infrastructure. Furthermore, the individual optimization of each domain is not enough; a system architecture must be designed to promote social implementation across fields. Designing such an architecture requires highly specialized system engineering expertise and experience; unfortunately, there is a critical shortage of such experts in Japan. For that reason, it is necessary to build a cross-ministerial promotion system, in reference to the efforts of organizations such as the United States' NIST25, and working in cooperation 25 National Institute of Standards and Technology 34 with relevant organizations in other countries, deploy Japan's limited number of specialists to conduct carry out system architecture design more efficiently and promote standardization. T he five areas of health, medical care, and long-term care, agriculture, national resilience (to disasters), transportation infrastructure and logistics, and regional revitalization are designated as priority areas. This is because Japan's top priority is finding solutions to social issues the country is facing, such as being the first country to face the full -blown effects of a declining birthrate and an aging population along with the resulting rapid increase in social security costs; decline in the workforce and shortage of healthcare and long -term care workers; extreme aging population of the agricultural work force; the increase in disasters and damage to agriculture, forestry and fisheries due to climate change and extreme weather; and the aging and deterioration of infrastructur e and the shortage of human resources to maintain infrastructure in regional Japan. In the health, medical care, and long-term care fields, the medium and long term goal is to achieve better health for the public , improved levels of medical and long-term care, and an improved working environment for health-related workers while simultaneously reducing the burden on taxpayers. In the area of regional revitalization (smart cities), this Strategy has foremost in mind regional cities (without excluding large cities). First of all, it is important to improve the quality of life in regional cities and regions and to nurture the development of local industries, but at the same time, aim to reduce the burden on local government finances. In doing so, rather than prioritizing the logic of the infrastructure and service providers, the perspectives of diverse residents and local businesses should be emphasized. This approach is firmly rooted in the principle of "a sustainable society that incorporates diversity", and is expected to contribute to the realization of high value-added services in the region. In addition, once social implementation of these five domains is realized in Japan, the high value - added services they generate can be expanded overseas, with unquestionable potential to contribute to the solution of global SDGs. ＜Main Objectives＞ 35 To bring together the wisdom of industry, academia and government, setting the following goals, with the building of a framework for sustainable social implementation in mind:  Based on a data infrastructure grounded in architecture design, being at the forefront globally in achieving AI social implementation in five key areas: (i) health, medical care and long - term care; (ii) agric ulture; (iii) national resilience (to disasters); (iv) transportation infrastructure and logistics; and (v ) regiona l revitalization (smart cities). In addition, undertaking efforts to achieve social implementation in manufacturing, finance and other fields  Promotion of participation of private sector actors in social implementation models for each domain (including studying the prospects for rolling out the entire system in overseas markets)  In health, medical care, and long -term care fields, maintaining an environment in which people feel assured that they can receive the most advanced and effective treatments as wells as high quality long -term care regardless of location, reducing the burden on medical care and long-term care providers  In the agricultural sector, almost all the business farmers utilizing data in their workflow by 2025  In the domain of national resilience, introducing a nationwide system to ensure the safety of infrastructure while minimizing maintenance and repair costs, and managing and sharing all types of data related to Japan's territory for that purpose  In the transportation infrastructure and logistics domain, exploring how to build the data infrastructure for distribution and logistics; improving productivity and increase added value in logistics and efficiency improvement of the

(FY 2020) [CSTI, IT, MHLW, MAFF, METI, MLIT] 50 III-2 Development of Data Related Infrastructure The thing that fundamentally supports advances in AI technology is large amount s of data. It is extremely important to collect high quality data, keep it safe from risks such as cyber-attacks and use it for analysis. For this reason, in order to keep pace with other countries, Japan also needs to work on coordination and standardization of data possessed by the government and the private sector. And in the process, prevent bias in big data and avert potential risks of AI utilization. On the other hand, it is extremely important to ensure the trustworthiness of data, authenticit y, and identify verification. In the United States there is already a trust infr astructure in the government procurement sector, and a common trust infrastructure in the EU is under construction.

As utilization of AI technology advances, it promises to radically improve corporate productivity, but for that to happen, it is essential to increase AI literacy in companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to promote matching bet ween the technical needs of these companies and the required AI technology seeds. Additionally, AI technology creates great opportunities to launch new startup companies. In fact, in the US and China, AI related venture capital investments are expanding rapidly, and many unicorn companies are emerging. Japan needs to provide an environment that encourages sharing of AI technology, effective utilization of AI in companies and government administration, and the creation of new products and services. ＜Main Objectives＞  Provision of data infrastructure and improvement of productivity and growth potential through AI utilization in low-productivity and growth sectors  Enhanced support for AI related business startups (1) Support for Small and Medium Enterprises ＜Specific Objective＞ Improving productivity of SMEs through utilization of AI (Initiatives)  Identification of the needs and issues of SMEs for problem-solving type AI human resource development projects (FY 2019) [METI]  Launch and progression of new service models through solution of management issues by problem-solving type AI human resource development projects, regional universities, etc. (FY 2020) [MEXT, METI] 58 (2) Support for Young AI Related Entrepreneurs ＜Specific Objective＞ Support for AI related start-up companies (Initiatives)  Implement measures based on the startup strategy "Beyond Limits. Unlock Our Potential" [CSTI, MEXT, METI] 59 I V. Ethics While interest in utilization of AI is increasing, an excessive pursuit of making life in our civilization ever more convenient could amplify the negative ramifications of AI. In order to minimize this, a high ethical perspective that reflects the cultural background is important, and so-called AI social principles are needed in order to promote the use of AI in a way that respects human beings . In light of these concerns, Japan formulated its Social Principles of AI and announced them in March of 2019; the EU did so in April of the same year. Subsequently in May of 2019, the OECD Ministerial Council adopted a recommendation on AI and then in June, at the G20 Trade and Digital Economy Ministers' Meeting, agreement was reached on principles for AI around the concept of "human-centric". Curren tly, in addition to Japan and the EU, countries such as Canada and Singapore are pursuing similar efforts, and discussions on ethics are also underway within international frameworks such as UNESCO and the G7. We can expect various debates around these issues, including about what new forms society should take, to become more and more active. At the "International Conference of Data Protection and Priva cy Commissioners", which brings together experts in the field, discussions about the development of guidelines which adhere to principles of AI ethics and data protection have begun. ＜Objective＞ Dissemination of the Social Principles of AI and establishment of an international collaboration system (Initiatives)  Establishment of seven AI social principles on social framework in the AI -Ready society of " Social Principles of Human-centric AI" (FY 2020) [CSTI, MIC, MEXT, MHLW, METI]  Establishment of a multilateral framework on the social principles of AI, including consideration for the prevention of ethics dumping 32 (FY 2021) [CSTI, PPC, MIC, MOFA, MEXT, MHLW, METI] 32 Ethics dumping: Conducting unethical research in countries/regions where ethics rules are loose. 60 V . Miscellaneous As previously mentioned, t he social and technological contexts surrounding AI have been rapidly changing and developing in recent years. Meanwhile, the United States, China, Europe, Canada, and various Asian countries, have formulated national AI strategies, and in Europe and Asia there ha s been a surge in international cooperation and international joint R&D among AI research centers in order to carry out these strategies.
